The Universal Logfile Multiplexer (ULM) is a java tool which solves the problem of monitoring large number of log files simultaneously, such as those produced during software installations - the use case which the tool was originally developed for. It makes it easier to view all the logs in one terminal session, prefixed by identifiers to let you know where they came from.
